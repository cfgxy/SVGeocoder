h1. SVGeocoder

SVGeocoder is a simple Cocoa wrapper for the "Google Geocoding Service":http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/. It allows you to quickly geocode and reverse-geocode addresses and coordinates. It is block-based, uses NSURLConnection internally as well as "JSONKit":https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit (included in package). Make sure you read the Google Geocoding Service "Terms of Service":http://code.google.com/apis/maps/terms.html#section_10_12 before using SVGeocoder. 

h2. Installation

* Drag the @SVGeocoder/SVGeocoder@ folder into your project. 
* Add the *CoreLocation*, *MapKit* and *AddressBook* frameworks to your project.

h2. Usage

h3. Using the Geocoding API

In it's simplest form, geocoding an address is as simple as:

<pre>
[SVGeocoder geocode:addressString
         completion:^(NSArray *placemarks, NSError *error) {
             // do something with placemarks, handle errors
         }];
</pre>

Where @placemarks@ is an array of @SVPlacemark@ objects (see more about that below). 

Additionally, you can use Google Geocoding API's @region@ and @bounds@ parameters to fine-tune your search:

<pre>
+ (SVGeocoder*)geocode:(NSString *)address bounds:(MKCoordinateRegion)bounds completion:(void (^)(NSArray *placemarks, NSError *error))block;
+ (SVGeocoder*)geocode:(NSString *)address region:(NSString *)region completion:(void (^)(NSArray *placemarks, NSError *error))block;
</pre>

h3. Using the Reverse Geocoding API

<pre>
[SVGeocoder reverseGeocode:CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(45.53264, -73.60518)
                completion:^(NSArray *placemarks, NSError *error) {
                    // do something with placemarks, handle errors
                }];
</pre>

h3. Cancelling requests

Make sure you cancel requests for which the user isn't waiting on anymore by keeping a pointer to your SVGeocoder object and calling @cancel@ on it. In all cases, the request will time out after 20s.

h2. About the SVPlacemark object

SVPlacemark is basically an "MKPlacemark":http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/MapKit/Reference/MKPlacemark_Class/Reference/Reference.html subclass but with a @coordinate@ property. Here's what an SVPlacemark object looks like:

<pre>
{
	address = {
		Country = Canada;
		CountryCode = CA;
		State = Quebec;
		Street = "3456 Rue Denis";
		ZIP = "J0K 1S0";
	},
	coordinate = {
		latitude = "46.01529";
		longitude = "-73.76997";
	},
	formattedAddress = "3456 Rue Saint-Denis, Montreal, QC H2L 4S9, Canada"
}
</pre>
